# xv6-i386-updated
xv6 for i386 

This xv6 was ported back to i386 for a small laptop i have wanted to use for a project.

The original to which i have based this version was done in 2015 by a group of students from Tokyo university.
Their article was so interesting i spent several days just ot get it to work to this point it is still buggy and 
needs alot of work.

This was the article i read about their work.
