# xv6-i386-updated
xv6 for i386 

This xv6 was ported back to i386 for a small laptop i have wanted to use for a project.

The orignal i have based this version was by a japanese group of strudent from tokyo university.
Their article was so interesting i spent several days just ot get it to work to this point it is still buggy and 
needs alot of work.

this was the article i read about their work.
