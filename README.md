# xv6-i386-updated
xv6 for i386 

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

The original README is included. please refer to that for further information about xv6.

My version of xv6 was ported back to i386 for a small laptop i have wanted to use for a project.

The original to which i have based this version was done in 2015 by a group of students from Tokyo university.
Their article was so interesting i spent several days just ot get it to work to this point it is still buggy and 
needs alot of work.

This was the article i read about their work.
